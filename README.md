# todo-list

This is a basic ToDo app, that can store and delete data. 
It is created using Javascript. JS was chosen since I was and still am learning the language.
I had some stuggles with the use of saving the data into an array, and am still struggling with the deleteion and editing of the data.

For now the app functions well as long as data isn't deleted or edited. You can add all the items you wish.
The checkbox strikes out the corresponding item so you know the task it completed.

Frontend is lacking since this is more a JS project than CSS.
