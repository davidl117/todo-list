# todo-list

This is a basic ToDo app, that can store and delete data. It uses JSON to store and parse data.
It is created using Javascript. JS was chosen since I was and still am learning the language.
I had some stuggles with the use of saving the data into an array, and am still struggling with the deleteion and editing of the data.
